. Interpretation of Results

• The analysis shows a higher number of bookings in City Hotels compared to Resort Hotels.

• Most cancellations occur during the peak travel months of July and August.

• The country-wise analysis indicates that the highest percentage of cancellations comes from Portugal (PRT).

• Weekly trends show that weekdays have varied booking patterns, with some days experiencing higher cancellations than others.

• ADR trends reveal that as cancellations decrease towards the end of the year, the average daily rate also tends to decline.

Suggestions

1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.

 Conclusion

The Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into booking trends, highlighting areas with higher cancellation rates and identifying patterns across different dimensions such as country, month, and weekdays. This analysis can help hotel management in decision-making and strategizing to improve booking retention and revenue.
